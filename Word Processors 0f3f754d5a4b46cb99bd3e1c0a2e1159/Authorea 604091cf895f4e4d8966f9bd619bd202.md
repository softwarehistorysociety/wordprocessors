URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea

**Authorea** is an [online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online) [collaborative writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_writing) tool that allows researchers to write, cite, collaborate, host data and publish. It has been described as "[Google Docs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs) for Scientists".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea) It has been owned by the commercial publishing company [Wiley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiley_(publisher)) through [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon) since 2018.

## Overview[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorea&action=edit&section=1)]

Authorea allows researchers to write documents together and attach references, figures, data, and source code. Features of the tool include collaborative editing (multiple people editing a document at the same time), automatic citation formatting, tracking changes, and the ability to make any document public or fully private.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea)

When used as an editing tool for [scientific papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_paper), Authorea will automatically format a paper in the preferred style and provide files suitable for online submission to [peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-reviewed) [journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal) and [conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_conference). Over 40 [publisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing)and journal-specific styles are currently supported.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea)

Authorea is part of the [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) movement and supports [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) publishing for academic research and [free access to research data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data). The free version of the service allows unlimited public documents, public storage space (for figures, data, code, and other supporting material), and an unlimited number of collaborators (co-authors) per document.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea) Public documents are free for anyone to read.

Authorea also supports private writing: a document and all its attachments can be kept private, visible only to co-authors. A free account allows the user to create one free private document, with more available via a paid subscription.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea)

Authorea also supports preprint workflows. Authorea partnered with [bioRxiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioRxiv) to enable authors to submit preprints directly to [bioRxiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioRxiv) from Authorea in 2017[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea). Additionally, preprint review hosting platform [PREreview](https://www.authorea.com/inst/14743-prereview) was built using Authorea technical infrastructure.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea)

The site currently supports an online [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) editor as well as a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (wiki) editor. A simple [MS Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Word)like ([WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)) interface is currently in development.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea)

Authorea grew from over 10,000 active users in 2014[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea) to over 50,000 in 2016.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea)

## History[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorea&action=edit&section=2)]

Authorea was launched in February 2013 by co-founders Alberto Pepe and Nathan Jenkins and scientific adviser Matteo Cantiello, who met while working at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea) They recognized common difficulties in the scholarly writing and publishing process.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea) To address these problems, Pepe and Jenkins developed an online, web-based editor to support real-time collaborative writing, and sharing and execution of research data and code. Jenkins finished the first prototype site build in less than three weeks.[[8][9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea)

Bootstrapping for almost two years, Pepe and Jenkins grew Authorea by reaching out to friends and colleagues, speaking at events and conferences, and partnering with early adopter institutions.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea).

In September 2014, Authorea announced the successful closure of a $610K round of seed funding with the New York Angels and [ff Venture Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ff_Venture_Capital) groups.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea) In January 2016, Authorea closed a $1.6M round of funding led by Lux capital and including the Knight Foundation and Bloomberg Beta [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea). It later acquired the VC-backed company [The Winnower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winnower) [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea).

In 2018 Authorea was acquired for an undisclosed amount by [Atypon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypon) (part of [Wiley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiley_(publisher))) [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea).

## Technical architecture[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authorea&action=edit&section=8)]

Authorea is built primarily with [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails), and documents and files are stored in [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) repositories. [Resque](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Resque&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Faye](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faye_(web_messaging_protocol)&action=edit&redlink=1) are used as well.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea)

The site supports [iPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython) [notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython) and runs a live iPython notebook server, so that users can attach, re-run and reproduce scientific calculations and data analysis directly in an Authorea document.[[3][13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorea)
