"During COVID-19 sequestering, Scripto has become even more indispensable. Wherever my staff is physically, Scripto brings us all together and communicates the needs of production seamlessly. We REALLY couldn't do The Late Show without Scripto, now."

Write with others in the same script at the same time, and see their changes appear live. Read at your own pace instead of relying on someone else's shared screen.

See what's been added (or removed) in each new draft, then send a link to the report or a PDF with revision asterisks. Revert to a previous version if you ever overdo it.

Our studio script format is specially geared towards the unique needs of the genre.

## Shows who know... trust Scripto

“In a world where we’re all suddenly working from home, Scripto is a godsend. It’s the fastest, easiest way for funny people to get their funny into the same script no matter where they are. It makes e-mailing FDX files back and forth look positively medieval; I honestly don’t know what we’d do without it.”
