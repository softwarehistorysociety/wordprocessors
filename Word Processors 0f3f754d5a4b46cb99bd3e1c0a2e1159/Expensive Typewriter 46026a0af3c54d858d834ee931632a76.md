**Expensive Typewriter** was a text editing program that ran on the [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation) [PDP-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1) computer[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expensive_Typewriter) that had been recently delivered at [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT).

## Information[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Expensive_Typewriter&action=edit&section=1)]

Since it could drive an [IBM Selectric typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter) (a [letter-quality printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter-quality_printer)), it may be considered the first [word processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processing) program. It was written and improved between 1961 and 1962 by Steve Piner and [L. Peter Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Peter_Deutsch). In the spirit of an earlier editor, named "[Colossal Typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Typewriter)", it was called "Expensive Typewriter" because at the time the PDP-1 cost a lot of money (approximately US$100,000) as compared to a typewriter.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]
