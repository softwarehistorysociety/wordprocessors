**A new tool has emerged that empowers just about anyone to create a game.** It's called Twine. It's extremely easy to use, and it has already given rise to a lively and diverse development scene.

Although plenty of independent games venture where mainstream games fear to tread, **Twine represents something even more radical:** the transformation of video games into something that is not only consumed by the masses but also created by them.

**The simple beauty of Twine is this:** if you can type words and occasionally put brackets around some of those words, you can make a Twine game.

**If you're interested in making interactive fiction then there's no better place to start than Twine.** It's possibly the simplest game making tool available, it will take you mere minutes to get started, and it has a wonderfully simple visual editor.

And aside from being free, it's really not programming at all â€” **if you can write a story, you can make a Twine game.**

**Twine is the closest we've come to a blank page.** It binds itself and it can bind itself along an infinite number of spines extending in any direction.
