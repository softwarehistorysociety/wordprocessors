It natively supports many [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages) and [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_languages), and functions can be added by users with [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plugins), typically community-built and maintained under [free-software licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licenses).

The interface of Sublime Text 2

**Themes**

- Sublime Text contains 23 different visual themes, with the option to download additional themes and configure custom themes via third-party plugins
- The minimap feature shows a reduced overview of the entire file in the top-right corner of the screen. The portion of the file visible in the main editor pane is highlighted and clicking or dragging in this view scrolls the editor through the file.

**Panels, groups and screen modes**

- The program offers a number of screen modes including panels that can show up to four files at once as well as full screen and distraction free modes which only show one file without any of the additional menus around it

### Features[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sublime_Text&action=edit&section=4)]

**Column selection and multi-select editing**

This feature allows users to select entire columns at once or place more than one cursor in text, which allows for [simultaneous editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_editing). All cursors then behave as if each of them was the only one in the text. Commands like move by character, move by line, text selection, move by words, move by subwords ([CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_Case), hyphen or underscore delimited), move to beginning/end of line, etc., affect all cursors independently, allowing one to edit slightly complex repetitive structures quickly without the need to use [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)) or [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text)

**Auto completion**

Sublime Text will offer to complete entries as the user is typing depending on the language being used. It also auto-completes variables created by the user.

**Syntax highlight and high contrast display**

The dark background on Sublime Text is intended to reduce eyestrain and increase the amount of contrast with the text. Syntax highlighting also makes syntaxes of the language easier to read.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]

**In-editor code building**

This feature allows users to run code for certain languages from within the editor, which eliminates the need to switch out to the command line and back again. This function can also be set to build the code automatically every time the file is saved.[[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)]

**Snippets**

This feature allows users to save blocks of frequently used code and assign keywords to them. The user can then type the keyword and press tab to paste the block of code whenever they require it.

**Goto anything**

This feature is a tool that allows users to switch between open, recent or project files and also navigate to symbols within them.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text)[[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)]

**Other features**

Sublime Text has a number of features in addition to these including:[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text)

- Auto-save, which attempts to prevent users from losing their work
- Customizable [key assignments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut), a navigational tool which allows users to assign hotkeys to their choice of options in both the menus and the toolbar
- Find as you type, begins to look for the text being entered as the user types without requiring a separate [dialog box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_box)
- Spell check function corrects as you type
- Macros
- Repeat the last action
- A wide selection of editing commands, including indenting and unindenting, paragraph reformatting and line joining

### Package manager[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sublime_Text&action=edit&section=5)]

Package Control is a third-party package manager for Sublime Text which allows the user to find, install, upgrade and remove [plug-ins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)), usually without restarting Sublime Text. The package manager keeps installed packages up-to-date with an auto-upgrade feature and downloads packages from [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub), [BitBucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket) and a custom JSON-encoded channel/repository system. It also handles updating packages cloned from GitHub and BitBucket via [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and [Hg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial_(software)), as well as providing commands for enabling and disabling packages. The package manager also includes a command to bundle any package directory into a .sublime-package file.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text)

PHP Hello World on Sublime Text 3

Version 3 entered beta on 29 January 2013. At first available only for registered users who had purchased Sublime Text 2, on 28 June 2013 it became available to the general public. However, the very latest development builds still required a registration code.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text) Sublime Text 3 was officially released on 13 September 2017.[[13][14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text)

Two of the main features that Sublime Text 3 adds include symbol indexing and pane management.

Pane Management allows users to move between panes via hotkeys.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text)
