Nvi is an implementation of the ex/vi text editor originally distributed as part of the Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD), by the University of California, Berkeley. The source code to nvi is freely available, and nvi may be freely redistributed.

Nvi supports all the historic ex/vi features except for open mode and the lisp edit option (e.g., it has a fully implemented underlying ex mode). It has a number of additional features as well:

- 8-bit clean data, lines and files limited by available memory
- Multiple edit buffers
- Colon command-line editing and path name completion
- Tag stacks (including support for Cscope databases)
- Extended Regular Expressions
- Infinite undo
- Horizontal scrolling
- Message catalogs (Dutch, English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Swedish)
- Preliminary support for Perl and Tcl/Tk scripting languages
