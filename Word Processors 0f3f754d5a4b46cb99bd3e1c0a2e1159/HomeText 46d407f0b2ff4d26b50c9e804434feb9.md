**HomePak**, published in 1984 by [Batteries Included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batteries_Included_(company)), is an integrated application written for the [Atari 8-bit family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family) and ported to the [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), [Commodore 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128), [IBM PCjr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PCjr), and [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePak) It includes a word processor (HomeText), database (HomeFind), and terminal communications program (HomeTerm). HomePak was designed by [Russ Wetmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Wetmore) (who previously wrote the game [Preppie!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preppie!_(video_game))) for Star Systems Software, Inc. The Commodore 128 version was ported by Sean M. Puckett and Scott S. Smith.

The original Atari 8-bit version of HomePak is implemented in the [Action!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_programming_language) programming language from [Optimized Systems Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimized_Systems_Software).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePak)

## Reception[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HomePak&action=edit&section=1)]

[Ahoy!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahoy!) warned "don't expect more than you pay for", stating that while HomeText was "quite nice" and HomeTerm was "wonderful," HomeFile was "very disappointing. Anyone who needs to use the [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) for even a mildly sophisticated operation will be frustrated and confused ... a total mess".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePak)

In a review of the HomeTerm portion of the package, Ron Luks wrote in a 1984 review for [ANALOG Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANALOG_Computing), "A superb terminal program is rare indeed, but in my collection of over two dozen Atari terminal programs, I have two or three that meet the "superb" criteria. Only one, however, can be the best. Hometerm is, quite simply, the best."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePak)

In a 1986 [Page 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_6) review, the author had technical problems using HomeTerm in the UK.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePak) He called HomeFind, "elegant, friendly and very easy to use," and wrote that HomeText, "might even tempt me away from my trusty old [Atariwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AtariWriter)."

## Legacy[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HomePak&action=edit&section=2)]

With Sparky Starks, Wetmore co-authored a similarly-styled application called HomeCard, an Atari 8-bit application advertised as an "electronic filing box" and "intelligent [Rolodex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolodex)." It was published by [Antic Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antic_Software) in 1985,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePak) not Batteries Included.
