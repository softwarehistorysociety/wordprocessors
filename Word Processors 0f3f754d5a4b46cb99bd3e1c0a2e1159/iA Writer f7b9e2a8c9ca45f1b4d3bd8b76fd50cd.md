No rulers, no formatting bars. iA Writer provides the crisp, uncluttered environment you need to write well, supported by discrete, powerful features, from Content Blocks, to Syntax Highlighting.

Focus is the key to good writing, and the guiding principle behind iA Writer. With shortcuts and simplified settings, you can keep your hands on the keyboard and your mind in the text.

We think every craftsperson should own their own tools, so when you download iA Writer, you own it. No forced subscriptions, microtransactions, or compatibility concerns. Your work, your files, your app.

# **Available for Mac, iOS, Windows, and Android.** Trial periods are limited to two weeks. The app will prompt you when the trial expires.

**Every app is purchased separately.** There are educational discounts and discounts for purchases over 20 apps. Trial periods are limited to two weeks. The app will prompt you when the trial expires.

## **Powerhouse.** iA Writer is so simple, it’s easy to overlook the wealth of features packed under the hood, from Focus Mode to PDF-Preview.

Highlight parts of speech to improve your writing. Spot superfluous adjectives, weak verbs, and unwanted repetitions. Developers have long used syntax highlighting to improve their code. Now you can hack your text.

Focus only on the sentence or paragraph that you’re working on. Introduced in 2010 with the original iA Writer, Focus Mode has since been copied by many writing apps. This is the original, and still (we think) the best.

Swap sections around, add media, and construct your content with flexible building blocks of text, .csv tables and image files. Stitch separate chapters together into one master file. Express yourself through experimentation.

We have created an innovative typeface for iA Writer, specifically designed to enhance the writing experience. The family comes in three flavors: classic Mono, Duo for larger screens, and Quattro for small devices.

iA Writer now offers a live, paginated PDF preview, parallel to the text you are editing. Instantly see how your document translates into PDF pages, as you edit.

iA Writer features one of the most advanced Markdown-to-Word export functions available anywhere. Export Markdown tables, images, and footnotes to Microsoft Word and back.

## **Working hard to keep it minimal.** We constantly improve and simplify iA Writer, expand its flexibility and fix occurring issues. [See all updates](https://ia.net/writer/whats-new)

## **Apple AppStore App of the Year 2011, 2012, and 2013.** MacStories App of the Year 2019. We win prizes. But what really make us happy are the notes we get from writers worldwide.
