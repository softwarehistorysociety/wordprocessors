Nota Bene 3.0
Released in 1990 by Dragonfly Software
For DOS

First released in 1982 and based on XyWrite, Nota Bene is a word
processor specifically tailored to academic use. It is a very
complex, unfriendly, program, but it is packed full of features.
Features include footnotes, endnotes, redlining, styles, outlining,
tables, indexes, bibliographies, a text retrieval system, foreign
language support, spell checker, thesaurus, and a built in
programming language. The Ibid component was an option that acted as
sort of a database of bibliographic references.

Archive includes thirteen 360k 5.25" floppy disk images.

The printer driver disks jump from disk 4 to 10. There aren't any 
disks missing. Disk 10 wasn't shipped with the software, it was a 
mail-order item. It includes drivers for printers not included in the 
base package.
