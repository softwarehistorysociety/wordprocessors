**AbiWord** ([/ˈæbiwɜːrd/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)) is a [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor). It was originally written in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and since version 3 it is based on [GTK+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK%2B) 3. The name "AbiWord" is derived from the root of the Spanish word "[abierto](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/en:abierto#Spanish)", meaning "open".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbiWord)

AbiWord was originally started by SourceGear Corporation as the first part of a proposed AbiSuite but was adopted by open source developers after SourceGear changed its business focus and ceased development. It now runs on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [ReactOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReactOS), Solaris, [AmigaOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaOS) 4.0 (through its [Cygnix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnix) [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) engine), [MeeGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeeGo) (on the [Nokia N9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N9) smartphone), [Maemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maemo) (on the [Nokia N810](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810)) [QNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX) and other [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). Development of a version for [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) has ended due to lack of maintainers (the latest released versions are 2.8.6 and 2.9.4 beta [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbiWord)).

The [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) port has remained on version 2.4 since 2005,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbiWord) although the current version does run non-natively on macOS through [XQuartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuartz).

AbiWord is part of the AbiSource project which develops a number of [office-related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_suite) technologies.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbiWord)

## Features[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AbiWord&action=edit&section=1)]

AbiWord supports both basic word processing features such as lists, indents and character formats, and more sophisticated features including tables, styles, page headers and footers, [footnotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_(typography)), templates, multiple views, page columns, [spell checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_checker), and [grammar checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar_checker).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbiWord) Starting with version 2.8.0, AbiWord includes a [collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_software) plugin that allows integration with AbiCollab.net, a Web-based service that permits multiple users to work on the same document [in real time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_real-time_editor), in full synchronization. The Presentation view of AbiWord, which permits easy display of presentations created in AbiWord on "screen-sized" pages, is another feature not often found in word processors.

### Interface[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AbiWord&action=edit&section=2)]

AbiWord generally works similarly to classic versions (pre-Office 2007) of [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word), as direct ease of migration was a high priority early goal. While many interface similarities remain, cloning the Word interface is no longer a top priority. The interface is intended to follow user interface guidelines for each respective platform.

### File formats[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AbiWord&action=edit&section=3)]

AbiWord comes with several import and export filters providing a partial support for such formats as [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) (.doc), [Office Open XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) (.docx),[[8][9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbiWord) [OpenDocument Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) (.odt), [Rich Text Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format) (.rtf), and [text documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) (.txt). [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is supported for export only. Plug-in filters are available to deal with many other formats, notably [WordPerfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPerfect) documents. The native [file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format), .abw, uses [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), so as to mitigate [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) concerns with respect to interoperability and [digital archiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_archiving).

### Grammar checking[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AbiWord&action=edit&section=4)]

The AbiWord project includes a US English-only grammar checking plugin using [Link Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Grammar). AbiWord had grammar checking before any other open source word processor, although a grammar checker was later added to [OpenOffice.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbiWord) Link Grammar is both a theory of syntax and an open source parser which is now developed by the AbiWord project.
