**Why use screenwriting software?**

Because you’re writing a screenplay — or a teleplay or stage play or any other kind of script. And while you could try and do it in Word (or Pages, or even a basic text editor like Notepad or TextEdit) there are some things — lots and lots of things, actually — that only proper screenwriting software can do. That’s where Fade In comes in.
