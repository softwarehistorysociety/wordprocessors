## Every tool you need in one place

### Real-time collaboration

It’s literally in the name. WriterDuet is built for collaboration with features like real-time co-writing, intuitive commenting, and in-app text and video chat. That makes us a favorite for writers’ rooms, sketch groups, and anybody who has a process built around feedback (or even just multiple devices).

### Powerful, customizable, and professional

Format effortlessly, customize your workflow, create custom templates, and lock pages or save revision drafts with one click so that you can spend more time writing.

### Integrated outlining, tagging, and filtering

Writing is rewriting, but that doesn't mean you should be forced to copy-paste a thousand times. WriterDuet integrates and organizes your beat sheets, treatments and outlines so that you can focus on the rewriting that your story actually needs.

”WriterDuet helped me escape Final Draft. Being web-based gives me the flexibility to write anywhere on any system. And I never have to worry about crashes and lost hours of work ever again. I recommend it to every other screenwriter I meet.”
