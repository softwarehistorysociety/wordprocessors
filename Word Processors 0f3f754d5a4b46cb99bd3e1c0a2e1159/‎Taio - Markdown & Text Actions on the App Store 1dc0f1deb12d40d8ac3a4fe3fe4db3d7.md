# Taio

Taio is a modern app for text editing, offers features for clipboard, text editor, and actions.

## Main Features

### Clipboard

Taio takes clipboard data as one of the input sources, you can capture it quickly for *temporary* use. Saved records can be synchronized across your iOS devices using iCloud, we also provide beautiful home screen widgets for better experience.

### Editor

Taio provides a full-fledged **Markdown** editor, it supports `CommonMark` and `GitHub Flavored` standards. Instead of telling you everything, we would like to highlight some great stuff here:

- Multi-Tab editing
- Multiple color themes
- Toolbar for beginners
- Outline view
- Wikilinks and backlinks
- Export to multiple formats
- Dynamic text in snippets
- Open file system that can be accessed by other apps
- Syntax highlighting for common programming languages

There are more interesting features we cannot cover here, please try it out!

### Actions

Text actions in Taio is a powerful mechanism to provide extensibility for both **clipboard** and **editor**, it works the same as the `Shortcuts` app.

You can build your own workflows using several action blocks, with support for variables and control flows.

Furthermore, if the built-in actions don't meet your needs, you can even write action blocks using **JavaScript**. The JavaScript engine in Taio is powered by JSBox, it provides tons of API bindings to interact with iOS.
