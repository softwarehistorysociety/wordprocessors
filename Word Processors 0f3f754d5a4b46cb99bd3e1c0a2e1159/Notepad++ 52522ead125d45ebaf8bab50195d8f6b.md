**Notepad++** is a [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) and [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor) for use with [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows). It supports [tabbed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_(GUI)) editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window. The project's name comes from the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) [increment operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increment_operator).

Notepad++ is distributed as [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software). At first the project was hosted on [SourceForge.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge.net), from where it has been downloaded over 28 million times,[[2][3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) and twice won the SourceForge Community Choice Award for Best Developer Tool.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) The project was hosted on [TuxFamily](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TuxFamily&action=edit&redlink=1) [[fr](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/TuxFamily)] from 2010 to 2015; since 2015 Notepad++ has been hosted on [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) Notepad++ uses the [Scintilla editor component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintilla_(software)).

## History[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notepad%2B%2B&action=edit&section=1)]

Notepad++ was developed by Don Ho in September 2003.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) The developer used JEXT (a [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))based text editor) at his company but, dissatisfied with its poor performance, he began to develop a text editor written in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) with [Scintilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintilla_(editing_component)).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) He developed it in his spare time since the idea was rejected by his company.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) Notepad++ was built as a Microsoft Windows application; the author considered, but rejected, the idea of using [wxWidgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets) to [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting) it to the [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) platforms.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

Notepad++ was first released on [SourceForge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge) on 25 November 2003, as a Windows-only application. It is based on the [Scintilla editor component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintilla_(editing_component)), and is written in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) with only [Win32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32) [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) calls using only the [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) to increase performance and reduce program size.[[7][8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

In January 2010 the US government obliged US-based open source project hosts to deny access from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria to comply with U.S. law.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) As a response to what the developer felt was a violation of the [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (FOSS) philosophy, in June 2010 Notepad++ moved out of US territorial jurisdiction by releasing a version on TuxFamily, in France. Some community services of Notepad++ (Such as the forums and bug tracker) remained on Sourceforge until 2015 when Notepad++ left Sourceforge completely.[[10][11][12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

In 2011 [Lifehacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifehacker) described Notepad++ as "The Best Programming Text Editor for Windows", stating that "if you prefer a simple, lightweight, and extensible programming plain-text editor, our first choice is the free, open-source Notepad++".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) Lifehacker criticized its [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface), stating that "It is, in fact, fairly ugly. Luckily you can do a lot to customize its looks, and what it lacks in polish, it makes up for in functionality".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

In 2014 [Lifehacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifehacker) readers voted Notepad++ as the "Most Popular Text Editor", with 40% of the 16,294 respondents specifying it as their most-loved editor.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) The Lifehacker team summarized the program as being "fast, flexible, feature-packed, and completely free".[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

In 2015 [Stack Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow) conducted a worldwide Developer Survey, and Notepad++ was voted as the most used [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) worldwide with 34.7% of the 26,086 respondents claiming to use it daily.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) Stack Overflow noted that "The more things change, the more likely it is those things are written in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) with NotePad++ on a Windows machine".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) The 2016 survey had Notepad++ at 35.6%.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

In 2015, in response to the [staff hijacking of projects hosted on SourceForge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge), Notepad++ left SourceForge completely with the forums being moved to NodeBB and the bug tracker to [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).[[12][17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

## Features[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notepad%2B%2B&action=edit&section=2)]

Notepad++ is a [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor). It features [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting), [code folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_folding) and limited [autocompletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocompletion) for [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), [scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language), and [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), but not [intelligent code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion) or syntax checking. As such, it may properly highlight code written in a supported schema, but whether the syntax is internally sound or compilable, cannot be verified.[[15][18][19][7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) As of version 7.6.3, Notepad++ can highlight the elements of 78 syntaxes:

The language list also displays two special-case items for ordinary [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text): "Normal text" (default) or "MS-DOS Style", which tries to emulate DOS-era text editors.

Notepad++ has features for consuming and creating cross-platform plain text files. It recognizes three [newline representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) (CR, CR+LF and LF) and can convert between them on the fly. In addition, it supports reinterpreting plain text files in various [character encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) and can convert them to [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) or [UCS-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCS-2). As such, it can fix plain text that seem gibberish only because [their character encoding is not properly detected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_hid_the_facts).

Notepad++ also has features that improve plain text editing experience in general, such as:

- [Autosave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosave)
- Finding and replacing strings of text with [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
- Guided indentation
- Line bookmarking
- [Macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science))
- [Simultaneous editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_editing)
    
    [[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)
    
- [Split screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_screen_(computer_graphics)) editing and synchronized scrolling
- Line operations, including sorting, case conversion (Uppercase, lowercase, camel case, sentence case), and removal of redundant whitespace
- [Tabbed document interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbed_document_interface)

### Plugins[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notepad%2B%2B&action=edit&section=3)]

Notepad++ has support for [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)) and [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) and has been marked for its robust plugin architecture which enabled various new features to be integrated into the program.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) Currently, over 140 compatible plugins are developed for Notepad++, 10 of which are included by default in the program.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) The first plugin to be included in the program was "TextFX", which includes W3C validation for HTML and CSS, text sorting, character case alteration and quote handling.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

### Internationalization[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notepad%2B%2B&action=edit&section=4)]

Notepad++ supports internationalization through XML files in an application-specific format containing all internationalized strings (dialog captions, menu titles and items, etc.) in a certain language; this file can be reloaded from the application settings. Translations to new languages can thus be written by simply editing an existing file.

## Controversies[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notepad%2B%2B&action=edit&section=5)]

In March 2008, the "[Boycott Beijing 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerns_and_controversies_over_the_2008_Summer_Olympics)" banner was placed on Notepad++'s SourceForge.net homepage.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) A few months later most users in China were unable to reach the SourceForge.net website from 26 June to 24 July 2008. This led to the widespread belief that China had banned SourceForge.net in retaliation for the Boycott banner.[[27][28][29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

In January 2015, the Notepad++ website was [hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker) by activists from the Fallaga Team who objected to an Easter egg endorsing [Je suis Charlie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je_suis_Charlie).[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) The Fallaga Team has been linked to [ISIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant) and is also believed to be responsible for the 2017 hacking of websites of the British [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

In October 2019, Notepad++ released a version codenamed "[Free Uyghur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps)" (v7.8.1). In the release notice, the author expressed concern that hundreds of thousands of Uighurs are believed to have been "subjected to political indoctrination, and sometimes even torture" in the Xinjiang Re-education Camp. He called for "additional pressure on the Chinese government to stop their oppressive actions and crimes concerning the Uyghur people".[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) The software's dedicated site came under a [distributed-denial-of-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed-denial-of-service) attack and its [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) issue page bombarded with nationalistic rhetoric, though it later recovered after being moved behind [Cloudflare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare)'s anti-DDoS service.[[33][34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)

In July 2020, Notepad++ released a version codenamed "[Stand with Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Hong_Kong_protests)" (v7.8.9). In the release notice, the author expressed his concern on the Chinese government implementation of the [National Security Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_national_security_law) in [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong).[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) In retaliation, Chinese browsers developed by [Tencent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent) ([QQ Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QQ_browser) and [WeChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat)’s built-in browser), [Alibaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group) ([UC Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Browser)), [360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360_Secure_Browser) and [Sogou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sogou) started blocking official site's "Download" page, but not other pages.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B)
