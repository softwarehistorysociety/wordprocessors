**Ami**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%AD) was the name of a word processing program developed and marketed by [Samna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samna) in the late 1980s,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%AD) which was later purchased by [Lotus Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Software) in 1990.[[3][4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%AD) Shortly after its introduction, the name of the program was changed to "Ami Pro".

Ami Pro was a significant competitor to [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) and [WordPerfect Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPerfect_Corporation)'s [WordPerfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPerfect) during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The developers of Ami Pro introduced a number of innovations in Ami Pro that were later adopted by other word processors.

At the time that Ami Pro was introduced, the word processing market was dominated by WordPerfect. Both Ami Pro and Microsoft Word made inroads into WordPerfect's market share. Eventually Microsoft Word overtook WordPerfect as the dominant player and Ami Pro was discontinued.

[IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM), the present owner of the Lotus brand, renamed it [Lotus Word Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Word_Pro).

## Overview[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Am%C3%AD&action=edit&section=1)]

The [16-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit) Ami Pro had significant limitations, most notably that it was unable to display the bottom of one page and the top of the next at the same time. The limitations were so severe that Lotus completely re-wrote the program from scratch when developing the [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit) version for [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95).

The 16-bit Ami Pro had significant benefits, too. Most notably, it was possible to easily control formatting with paragraph styles that were set with function keys, and were locked in for the whole paragraph. (They were not erased with the deletion of the last character of the paragraph as they are with Microsoft Word.)

One difference between Ami Pro and Lotus Word Pro is: Ami Pro used the three character file extension of ".sam" and Lotus Word Pro used the extension of ".lwp"
