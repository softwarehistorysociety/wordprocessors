## Overview[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_First_XLEnt_Word_Processor&action=edit&section=1)]

The First XLEnt Word Processor was released without copy protection in 1986 for US$29.95 (equivalent to $69.86 in 2019). It runs on [Atari 8-bit family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family) computers with 48 kB of RAM.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_XLEnt_Word_Processor) Other contemporary word processors for the Atari platform include [PaperClip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaperClip), [AtariWriter Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AtariWriter), and Letter Perfect.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_XLEnt_Word_Processor)

The word processor includes cut-and-paste block moves of up to one screen,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_XLEnt_Word_Processor) search-and-replace, chaining files, support for a variety of printers including graphics, mail merge, the insertion of graphics into a text document, inserting a text file into another text file, controlling the cursor with a joystick, editing two documents simultaneously, and raw text file export.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_XLEnt_Word_Processor)

## Reception[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_First_XLEnt_Word_Processor&action=edit&section=2)]

Charles Cherry of [Antic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antic_(magazine)) called it, "as good or better than any other word processor you'll find for the 8-bit Atari". His list of advantages included performance and "very comprehensive printing capabilities". In a later comparison of seven word processors, Antic cited the issues with The First XLEnt Word Processor as, "the cut-and-paste buffer holds you to one screenâ€”800 characters. Also, the printing section in the manual could be more informative."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_XLEnt_Word_Processor) When version 2.1 was released, Antic's Gregg Pearlman wrote, "First XLEnt Word Processor came highly recommended in its original version, and Version 2.1 merits an even longer look."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_XLEnt_Word_Processor)
