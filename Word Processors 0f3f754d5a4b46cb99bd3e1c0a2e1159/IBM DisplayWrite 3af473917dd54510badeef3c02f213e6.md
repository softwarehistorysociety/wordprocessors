**DisplayWrite** (sometimes written as **Displaywrite**) was a [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor) software application that [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM) developed and marketed for the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC) and [PCjr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PCjr). It was among the company's first internally developed, commercially sold PC software.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DisplayWrite)

DisplayWrite's feature set was based on the [IBM Displaywriter System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Displaywriter_System), a dedicated [microcomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer)based word processing machine.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DisplayWrite) Because the two systems were so similar, an experienced Displaywriter user could start using DisplayWrite immediately.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DisplayWrite)

## Versions[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_DisplayWrite&action=edit&section=1)]

### DisplayWrite/PC[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_DisplayWrite&action=edit&section=2)]

For the [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) platform there were DisplayWrite versions for PC/MS-DOS and DisplayWrite 5/2 programmed under [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DisplayWrite)

Main article: [IBM Office/36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Office/36)

DisplayWrite/36 was the word processing component of IBM Office/36, which allowed an office to use the SQL-based database file for labels and form letters.

### DisplayWrite/370[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_DisplayWrite&action=edit&section=4)]

DisplayWrite/370, a much more powerful version with full graphics and [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) support, was supported for [IBM zSeries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_zSeries) mainframe computers until May 2015.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DisplayWrite) (see [IBM Displaywriter System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Displaywriter_System)). DW/370 was a host-based word processor.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DisplayWrite) It was marketed between 1993 and 2015 for MVS/CICS[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DisplayWrite) (now z/OS) and VM/CMS[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DisplayWrite).

## File format[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IBM_DisplayWrite&action=edit&section=5)]

IBM DisplayWrite's native file format is based on IBM's DCA ([Document Content Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Content_Architecture)) RFT ([Revisable Form Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisable-Form_Text)) specification, but adds additional structures. Depending on the DisplayWrite version, the document files use .DOC or .TXT file name extension. The DisplayWrite software can export to and import from pure DCA/RFT files (which typically have .DCA or .RFT file name extension). RFT (IBM Revisable Form Text) should not be confused with RTF ([Rich Text Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format)), which is a Microsoft specification.
