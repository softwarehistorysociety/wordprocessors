**Notes** is a [notetaking app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notetaking_software) developed by [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple,_Inc). It is provided on their [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) operating systems, the latter starting with [OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mountain_Lion). It functions as a service for making short text notes, which can be synchronised between devices using Apple's [iCloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud) service.

The application uses a similar interface on iOS and macOS, with a textured paper background for notes and light yellow icons, suggesting pencil or crayon. Until 2013, both applications used a strongly [skeuomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorphism) interface, with a lined paper design; the Mountain Lion version placed this inside a leather folder. This design was replaced in [OS X Mavericks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mavericks) and [iOS 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_7).

## iOS version[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notes_(Apple)&action=edit&section=1)]

### iOS 9[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notes_(Apple)&action=edit&section=2)]

Starting with [iOS 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_9), Notes received a significant functional overhaul; [iCloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud) sync (instead of [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol); in-line with the [OS X 10.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_El_Capitan) version), the ability to create [sketches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_illustration) (and later, support for [Apple Pencil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil)), advanced [text formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatted_text) options, several styles of lists, rich web and [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Maps) link previews, support for more file type attachments, a corresponding dedicated attachment browser, and a system share extension point for saving web links, images, etc.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple))

As of iOS 9.3, individual notes can be password-protected (with the ability to use [Touch ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID) to unlock all notes on compatible devices), however only one password can be set for all notes locked henceforth. The password syncs across compatible devices.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple))

### iOS 10[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notes_(Apple)&action=edit&section=3)]

In [iOS 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_10), Notes now has a collaboration feature for many people to work on a note at the same time.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple))

### iOS 11[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notes_(Apple)&action=edit&section=4)]

The update to Notes released with [iOS 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_11) adds tables,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) pinned notes,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) a document scanner,[[5][6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) graph and lined paper,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) [monospaced text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font) support,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) handwriting search,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) and improved integration with [Apple Pencil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil). Tapping the Pencil on the Lock screen will bring up a new note with drawing active; the Pencil can also be used while in the Notes app to start an inline drawing.

## macOS version[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notes_(Apple)&action=edit&section=5)]

Prior to Mountain Lion, [Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_(Apple)) on macOS supported a mailbox containing notes, which was synced with notes in the Notes application in iOS. This situation was a [kludge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge): as Mail already implemented the [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP) mailbox synchronisation protocol, it could also sync notes with minimal additional work.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple))

In Mountain Lion, notes were moved to a separate Notes application.[[8][9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) Created notes are synced through all the user's [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) devices through the [iCloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud) service. Notes can be arranged in folders, and pinned to the user's desktop. When the application is closed, the pinned note still remains. Additionally, unlike the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch version, the OS X Mountain Lion Notes application allows for images to be embedded within notes.

Originally, notes could be created in three different default fonts - Noteworthy, Marker Felt, and [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica). Users could also add custom fonts by visiting the "Show Fonts" menu. The menu allows users to change text size, format lists, choose the alignment (left, center, justify, or right), assign a writing direction, and indent text. Attachments, images, and [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) can also be added into a note. Attachments cannot be viewed on iOS devices.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple))

### OS X 10.11[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notes_(Apple)&action=edit&section=6)]

As of [OS X 10.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_El_Capitan), Notes received a significant functional overhaul (in-line with the [iOS 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_9) version), with major features including [iCloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud) sync, the ability to view [sketches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_illustration) created on the iOS counterpart, advanced [text formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatted_text) options, several styles of lists, rich web and [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Maps) link previews, support for more file type attachments, a corresponding dedicated attachment browser, and a system share extension point for saving web links, images, etc.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple))

As of OS X El Capitan 10.11.4, individual notes can be password-protected, with the password syncing across compatible devices.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple))

### macOS 10.13[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notes_(Apple)&action=edit&section=7)]

The update to Notes released with [macOS 10.13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_High_Sierra) adds tables.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple))

## In popular culture[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notes_(Apple)&action=edit&section=8)]

Social media users have often used the Notes application to write short notes which can then be posted as a [screenshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot) to social media sites such as Instagram or Twitter.[[14][15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) Writers have noted that this form of communication has often been used by celebrities to make public statements, perhaps to give them an informal feel or extend beyond platform character limits, including often to post public apologies.[[16][17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple))
