**Lexicon** was a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) / [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor) [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) program that was extremely popular in the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) at the end of 1980s and in 1990s. Some estimate that Lexicon was illegally installed on 95% of all Russian PCs. The last version for MS-DOS was 1.4. Later [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) versions were developed, but they were not popular, due to easily available pirated copies of [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word).

Lexicon was originally developed at the Computing Center of the [Academy of Sciences of the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_USSR) by Ye. N. Veselov.

Lexicon could produce and edit [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) files; at the same time, it could enrich them with various formatting codes (which all started with the character 255 (0xFF)). Lexicon also included a [spell checker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_checker).

Lexicon supported operations with linear and rectangular blocks; it also had convenient means for drawing tables with [box drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_drawing_characters).

Lexicon could work with both osnovnaya (primary) and [alternativnaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_866) (alternative) character sets. It also included its own screen and printer fonts and keyboard drivers for use with non-russified computers.
