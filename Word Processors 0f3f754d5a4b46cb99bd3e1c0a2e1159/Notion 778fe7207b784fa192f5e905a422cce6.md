## History[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notion_(app)&action=edit&section=1)]

Notion Labs Inc, a [startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company) based in San Francisco, was founded in 2016. The founders declined to meet [venture capitalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital) or acquiring a higher [valuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(app))

The app launched in March 2016 for [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) and [OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X), May 2017 for [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), and June 2017 for [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS).

In March 2018, the software was upgraded to Notion 2.0, receiving praise on [Product Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Hunt) as #1 Product of the Month[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(app)), and being featured on an article[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(app)) in [WSJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal). The company had fewer than 10 employees at this point.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(app))

In June 2018, an official app for [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) was released.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(app))

In September 2019, the company announced it hit 1 million users.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(app))

## Software[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notion_(app)&action=edit&section=2)]

**Notion** is a [collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_software) platform with modified [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) support that integrates [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) boards, tasks, [wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software), and databases. The company claims to be an all-in-one workspace for [note-taking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notetaking_software), [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management_software) and [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet) management, [project and task management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_software).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(app))The software is described as a file management tool offering a unified workspace, allowing users to comment on ongoing projects, to participate in discussions and receive feedback from others. In addition to [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software) apps, it can be accessed via most [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser). It features a web clipper. The company's tool helps users to schedule tasks, manage files, save documents and set a reminder for the weekly agenda, enabling users to organize their work. It allows users to [embed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/embed) any online content within Notion pages using Embed.ly.

### Pricing[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Notion_(app)&action=edit&section=3)]

Notion has a four-tiered [subscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model) model: free, personal, team, and enterprise. The application offers an account credit system, and can earn credit via [referrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_marketing). Users will not be charged if they have a remaining balance in their accounts.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] As of May 2020, the company upgraded the Personal Plan to allow an unlimited number of blocks as opposed to the cap on the number of blocks till then.
